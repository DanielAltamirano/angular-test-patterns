## Performance Testing AngularJS

### Benchpress

[Benchpress](https://github.com/angular/benchpress) is a new performance testing tool built by the AngularJS team.

### ng-bench

Another option is the [ng-bench](https://github.com/jbdeboer/ng-bench) project built on top of karma and jasmine.

This is something I haven't done in AngularJS yet, and have not personally tried out the tools mentioned above, so I'm looking for community input on what works well.

### What is working well for you?
