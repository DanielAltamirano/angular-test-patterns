## A / B Testing AngularJS

You have goals that you want your visitors to accomplish (e.g., make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter) or metrics you want to improve (e.g., revenue, visit duration, bounce rate). A/B testing lets you test which version leads to the greatest improvement.

### [ab-test-service](https://github.com/daniellmb/ab-test-service)

An AngularJS service for creating imperative A/B/n tests in your AngularJS projects. This service makes no assumptions
about how your application is set up or how you want to use it. While for most applications a single A/B test service
created at config time will be all you need. There's no reason why you can't lazily create the A/B test service, or have
multiple instances.

### [ab.js](https://github.com/daniellmb/ab.js)

Make user-driven decisions with this 214 byte A/B test micro-library, that is completely self contained with no external dependencies. Use ab.js to choose a cryptographically random A/B test variant and log the results to your database. How you analyze the actionable data is up to you. Testing different versions of copy text, layouts, images and colors in the browser has never been more simple.
