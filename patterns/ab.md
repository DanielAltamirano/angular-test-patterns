## A / B Testing AngularJS

You have goals that you want your visitors to accomplish (e.g., make a purchase, sign up for a newsletter) or metrics you want to improve (e.g., revenue, visit duration, bounce rate). A/B testing lets you test which version leads to the greatest improvement. 

##### Testing Patterns

* Headline
* Image
* Call to action
* Layout

This is something I'm working on right now... coming soon, for a sneak peak check out [ab.js](https://github.com/daniellmb/ab.js) and [ab-test-service](https://github.com/daniellmb/ab-test-service).

### What is working well for you?
